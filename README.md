# Lab
Another Labirint game for DOS I've made ~mid 90s. Still runs under DOS-Box.

Goal of the game is to explore as large space as possible.
Gold is gathered to make explosions :)

Controls are:

Arrows - move.

F2 - explosion of 3x3 area around the player. Walls turn into gold.

Each explosion costs 30 gold.

q - give up and save the score

F5 - makes dungeon 'fade away'

F10 - exit the game.
